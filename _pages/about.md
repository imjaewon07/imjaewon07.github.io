I am a fifth-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Alex Luedtke](https://alexluedtke.com).  

My research focuses on **causal inference**, **data fusion**, and **semiparametric efficiency theory**, with an emphasis on efficient estimation and statistical inference for smooth function-valued parameters. In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19094), I develop methods for estimating causal dose-response functions under **data fusion**. This framework incorporates partially aligned data sources to estimate dose-response functions and demonstrates that data fusion yields tighter finite-sample regret bounds and improved worst-case performance, supported by **minimax lower-bound** comparisons.

I am also working with [Thomas Fleming](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/thomas-fleming) and collaborators at Regeneron on developing sample size calculation methods for recurrent event data under the Andersen-Gill model with between-subject heterogeneity. In addition to methodological work, I have participated in several applied statistical projects in epidemiology and public health, including differential network analysis with [Ali Shojaie](https://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html) and cardiovascular and metabolic disease research with the CHSCC under [Robyn McClelland](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/robyn-mcclelland).
