I am a fifth-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by [Alex Luedtke](https://alexluedtke.com).  

My research focuses on causal inference, data fusion, and semiparametric efficiency theory, with an emphasis on estimation and inference for smooth function-valued parameters that do not admit efficient influence functions. In this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19094), I develop methods for estimating causal dose–response functions under data fusion. This framework incorporates partially aligned data sources to estimate dose–response functions, and demonstrates that data fusion yields tighter finite-sample regret bounds and improved worst-case performance, supported by minimax lower-bound comparisons.

I am also working with [Thomas Fleming](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/thomas-fleming) and collaborators at Regeneron on developing sample size calculation methods for recurrent event data under the Andersen–Gill model with between-subject heterogeneity. In addition to methodological work, I have participated in several applied statistical projects in epidemiology and public health, including differential network analysis with [Ali Shojaie](https://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html) and cardiovascular and metabolic disease research with the CHSCC under [Robyn McClelland](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/robyn-mcclelland).
