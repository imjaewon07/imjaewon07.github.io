<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a fifth-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://alexluedtke.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Alex Luedtke</a>.</p> <p>My research focuses on causal inference, data fusion, and semiparametric efficiency theory, with an emphasis on estimation and inference for smooth function-valued parameters that do not admit efficient influence functions. In this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19094" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>, I develop methods for estimating causal dose–response functions under data fusion. This framework incorporates partially aligned data sources to estimate dose–response functions, and demonstrates that data fusion yields tighter finite-sample regret bounds and improved worst-case performance, supported by minimax lower-bound comparisons.</p> <p>I am also working with <a href="https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/thomas-fleming" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Thomas Fleming</a> and collaborators at Regeneron on developing sample size calculation methods for recurrent event data under the Andersen–Gill model with between-subject heterogeneity. In addition to methodological work, I have participated in several applied statistical projects in epidemiology and public health, including differential network analysis with <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ali Shojaie</a> and cardiovascular and metabolic disease research with the CHSCC under <a href="https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/robyn-mcclelland" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robyn McClelland</a>.</p> </body></html>
